Infrastructure:
I would recommend to setup all the AWS resources using Terraform or CloudFormation according to IaC paradigm. We would need to use at least EKS, EC2, ELB and Route53

Kubernetes configuration:
To optimally deploy the mentioned application I would recommend to fit to the set of following rules:
- configure resources and limits according to standard application usage
- setup HA of the application using topologySpreadConstrains, podDisruptionBudgets and cluster autoscaler with horizontal pod autoscaler
- secure cluster f.e. by configuring ingress security group, exgress only node network, CNI or service mesh based pod networkPolicy, encryption at rest and encryption in transit
- implement monitoring and visualisation tools to control the state of a cluster
- choose preferred way of executing deployments ( Helm based deployment model of GitOps way of performing updates )
