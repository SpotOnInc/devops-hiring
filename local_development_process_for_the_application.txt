For the local development the solution will be using the Docker Compose. You don't have use the Kubernetes (you have to change an application instance fast).

No Docker Compose:
"docker build -t django-app:latest ."

Docker Compose:
1) build the image: "docker-compose up -d",
2) rebuild the image (if you change the application code): "docker-compose up --build -d",
3) remove all data: "docker-compose down -v --rmi all --remove-orphans".

We can easily add a database or queue if needed to have whole stack in one file.
